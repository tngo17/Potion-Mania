            <p>You are in a town called Witch's Cove. As a young aspiring <!--
            -->alchemist, you are on a mission to create a potion that is <!--
            -->not only unheard of, but also powerful in many different ways. <!--
            -->Ahead of you, you notice a cottage that is rickety and dishevelled. <!--
            -->You wonder what could be inside.</p>
